## 🎯 Development Workflow

### TDD Approach
1. **Red**: Write failing test first
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass
3. **Refactor**: Clean up while keeping tests green
4. **Repeat**: Move to next requirement

### Epic Completion Order
```
Epic 1 → Epic 2 → Epic 4 → Epic 3 → Epic 5 → Epic 6 → Epic 7
   ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓
Models   API     UI      Shops   Analytics Design   Deploy
```

## 🚀 Implementation Guidelines

### Getting Started
1. **Begin with Epic 1**: All other epics depend on the domain models
2. **Follow TDD**: Write failing tests first, then implement
3. **Use Epic Files**: Each epic contains detailed, copilot-friendly prompts
4. **Track Progress**: Check off tasks as completed
5. **Validate Continuously**: Run tests after each task

### Development Workflow
```
Epic File → Task Prompt → TDD Implementation → Test Validation → Next Task
```

### Task Execution Process
1. Read the task prompt from the epic file
2. Copy the prompt to Copilot for implementation
3. Follow TDD: Red → Green → Refactor
4. Validate all tests pass
5. Check off the completed task
6. Move to next task

### Epic Dependencies
- **Epic 1** → Blocks all other epics
- **Epic 2** → Required for Epic 4, Epic 5
- **Epic 3** → Required for Epic 4
- **Epic 4** → Required for Epic 6
- **Epic 5** → Can start after Epic 2
- **Epic 6** → Requires Epic 4
- **Epic 7** → Can start in parallel, requires all others for full deployment

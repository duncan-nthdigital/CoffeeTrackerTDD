## ü§ñ Copilot Prompt

```
Create a Blazor component called `CoffeeEntryForm` for logging coffee consumption in a .NET 8 Blazor Web App.

Component requirements:
- File location: `src/CoffeeTracker.Web/CoffeeTracker.Web/Components/Features/CoffeeEntryForm.razor`
- Use Bootstrap 5 for styling
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Support both Interactive Server and WebAssembly render modes

Form fields needed:
1. Coffee Type dropdown - Required with validation, Bootstrap select styling
2. Coffee Size radio buttons - Required with validation, display caffeine multiplier
3. Coffee Source text input - Optional, max 100 chars, auto-suggest placeholder
4. Real-time caffeine display - Dynamic calculation, friendly descriptions

Features to implement:
- Form validation using DataAnnotations and Blazor validation
- Loading state during API submission with spinner
- Success/error message display with toast notifications
- Form reset after successful submission
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Auto-focus on first field, optimized tab order
- Enter key submits form, visual feedback for all interactions

API integration:
- Inject HttpClient for API calls
- POST to /api/coffee-entries endpoint
- Handle HTTP errors and display user-friendly messages
- Show loading spinner during submission

State management:
- Use component state for form data
- Implement proper two-way binding
- Handle validation state changes
- Clear form after successful submission

Create comprehensive unit tests using bUnit:
- Test form rendering with all fields
- Test validation behavior
- Test API integration (mocked)
- Test responsive behavior
- Test error handling scenarios

Create supporting CSS file with component-scoped styles.

Example usage: `<CoffeeEntryForm OnEntryAdded="HandleEntryAdded" />`
```

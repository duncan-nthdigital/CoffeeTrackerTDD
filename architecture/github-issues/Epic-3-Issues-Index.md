## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Notes

**API Design:**
- Read-only API for Phase 1 (no coffee shop creation/editing)
- Consistent with Epic 2 API patterns and conventions
- Integrated Swagger documentation with coffee entry APIs
- RESTful endpoints following same standards

**Search Strategy:**
- Case-insensitive partial matching on name and address
- Results ordered by relevance (exact matches first)
- Support for special characters and international names
- Pagination to handle large result sets

**Performance Considerations:**
- Database queries optimized with proper indexing
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed shops
- Pagination implemented at database level
- Search results cached for 15 minutes

**Future Enhancement Preparation:**
- Geographic coordinates optional but prepared for GPS features
- Search algorithm can be enhanced with fuzzy matching
- Foundation for shop ratings and reviews (future epics)
- Integration points prepared for mobile app development

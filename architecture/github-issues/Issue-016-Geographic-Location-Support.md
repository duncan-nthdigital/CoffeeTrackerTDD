- Support query parameters: lat, lng, maxResults, maxDistance

## ü§ñ Copilot Prompt

```csharp
Add geographic location support to the coffee shop system in a .NET 8 Web API project.

Model updates needed:
1. Update CoffeeShop model to include:
   - Latitude (decimal, nullable, precision 10,8)
   - Longitude (decimal, nullable, precision 11,8)
   - HasCoordinates (computed property)

2. Create migration for new fields
   - Update existing seed data with realistic coordinates
   - Add indexes for geographic queries

Location services needed:
1. Create `ILocationService` interface with methods:
   - double CalculateDistance(decimal lat1, decimal lon1, decimal lat2, decimal lon2)
   - Task<IEnumerable<CoffeeShopResponse>> GetNearestShopsAsync(decimal latitude, decimal longitude, int maxResults, double maxDistanceKm)
   - bool IsValidCoordinate(decimal latitude, decimal longitude)

2. Implement `LocationService` with:
   - Haversine formula for distance calculation
   - Input validation for coordinates
   - Performance-optimized database queries
   - Support for both miles and kilometers

API updates:
1. Add to CoffeeShopsController:
   - GET /api/coffee-shops/nearest?lat={lat}&lng={lng}&maxResults={n}&maxDistance={km}
   - Return shops sorted by distance with distance included
   - Add comprehensive Swagger documentation for location parameters
   - Document coordinate validation rules and error responses

2. Update CoffeeShopResponse DTO:
   - Add optional Distance property (decimal, in km)
   - Add HasLocation property (bool)
   - Include Swagger schema annotations for new properties

Geographic features:
- Validate latitude (-90 to 90) and longitude (-180 to 180)
- Handle shops without coordinates gracefully
- Return distance in kilometers with 2 decimal precision
- Sort results by distance (nearest first)
- Limit results to reasonable radius (e.g., 50km max)

Seed data updates:
- Add realistic coordinates for major cities
- Use coordinates for diverse locations (US, Europe, Australia, etc.)
- Ensure coordinates match the addresses provided

Create comprehensive unit tests:
- Distance calculation accuracy (test known distances)
- Coordinate validation
- Nearest shops functionality
- Edge cases (North/South poles, International Date Line)
- Performance with large datasets

Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation:
- Document all location-related endpoints with comprehensive parameter descriptions
- Add example coordinates and responses
- Document validation rules and error scenarios
- Include geographic coordinate format specifications
- Add proper response schemas for location-based queries

XML Documentation Requirements:
- Document all location service methods with clear summaries
- Include parameter descriptions for latitude, longitude, and distance values
- Document return values and error conditions
- Provide usage examples for location calculations

Note: This is a foundation for future GPS integration in mobile apps.

Place location service in `Services/LocationService.cs` and update relevant DTOs and controllers.

## üìã Notes

### Haversine Formula Implementation
The Haversine formula calculates great-circle distances between two points on Earth:
```
a = sin¬≤(ŒîœÜ/2) + cos œÜ1 ‚ãÖ cos œÜ2 ‚ãÖ sin¬≤(ŒîŒª/2)
c = 2 ‚ãÖ atan2( ‚àöa, ‚àö(1‚àía) )
d = R ‚ãÖ c
```
Where œÜ is latitude, Œª is longitude, R is earth's radius

### Sample Coordinates for Testing
- New York City: 40.7128, -74.0060
- London: 51.5074, -0.1278
- Sydney: -33.8688, 151.2093
- Tokyo: 35.6762, 139.6503
- San Francisco: 37.7749, -122.4194

### Performance Considerations
- Database indexes on latitude and longitude columns
- Efficient bounding box calculations before distance computation
- Limit maximum search radius to prevent expensive queries
- Consider spatial database extensions for production use

### Future Enhancements
- Integration with mapping services for address geocoding
- Advanced spatial queries using PostGIS or SQL Server spatial types
- Caching of distance calculations for frequently requested locations
- Support for polygonal search areas instead of circular radius

## üìù Implementation Details

### File Locations
- **Component**: `src/CoffeeTracker.Web/CoffeeTracker.Web/Components/Features/DailyCoffeeSummary.razor`
- **CSS**: `src/CoffeeTracker.Web/CoffeeTracker.Web/Components/Features/DailyCoffeeSummary.razor.css`
- **Tests**: `test/CoffeeTracker.Web.Tests/Components/Features/DailyCoffeeSummaryTests.cs`

### Summary Display Sections
1. **Daily Overview Cards**
   - Total coffees today (large number with icon)
   - Total caffeine (mg) with health indicator
   - Average per coffee entry
   - Time of last coffee

2. **Caffeine Health Indicator**
   - Progress bar showing daily caffeine intake
   - Color coding: Green (0-200mg), Yellow (200-400mg), Orange (400-600mg), Red (600mg+)
   - Recommended daily limit indicator (400mg)

3. **Coffee Entries List**
   - Chronological list of today's entries
   - Each entry: time, type, size, source, caffeine amount
   - Mobile-friendly card layout
   - Empty state message when no entries

## ü§ñ Copilot Prompt

```
Create a Blazor component called `DailyCoffeeSummary` that displays coffee consumption analytics for anonymous users in a .NET 8 Blazor Web App.

Component requirements:
- File location: `src/CoffeeTracker.Web/CoffeeTracker.Web/Components/Features/DailyCoffeeSummary.razor`
- Use Bootstrap 5 for styling with custom CSS
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Auto-refresh when new entries are added

Summary display sections:
1. Daily Overview Cards - Total coffees, caffeine, averages, last coffee time
2. Caffeine Health Indicator - Progress bar with color coding and safety levels
3. Coffee Entries List - Chronological display with timestamps and details
4. Quick Stats - Most consumed type, favorite source, peak times

Visual features:
- Icons for different coffee types
- Color-coded caffeine amounts with health indicators
- Smooth animations for data updates
- Loading skeletons while data loads
- Responsive grid layout

API integration:
- GET from /api/coffee-entries endpoint
- GET daily summary from API
- Handle loading states and errors
- Refresh data on component initialization

Real-time updates:
- Subscribe to coffee entry events (via EventCallback)
- Refresh data when OnEntryAdded is triggered
- Smooth animations for value changes

Create comprehensive unit tests using bUnit covering rendering, empty state, calculations, and responsive behavior.

Example usage: `<DailyCoffeeSummary OnRefreshRequested="RefreshData" />`
```

- Support for different selection modes
- Include caffeine information display
- Mobile-friendly touch interactions
- Accessibility compliance
- Bootstrap card components with custom styling

## üìù Implementation Details

### File Locations
- **Component**: `src/CoffeeTracker.Web/CoffeeTracker.Web/Components/Shared/CoffeeTypeSelector.razor`
- **CSS**: `src/CoffeeTracker.Web/CoffeeTracker.Web/Components/Shared/CoffeeTypeSelector.razor.css`
- **Tests**: `test/CoffeeTracker.Web.Tests/Components/Shared/CoffeeTypeSelectorTests.cs`

### Coffee Types to Support
- Espresso: 90mg, "Strong, concentrated shot"
- Americano: 120mg, "Espresso with hot water"
- Latte: 80mg, "Espresso with steamed milk"
- Cappuccino: 80mg, "Equal parts espresso, milk, foam"
- Mocha: 90mg, "Espresso with chocolate"
- Macchiato: 120mg, "Espresso 'marked' with milk"
- Flat White: 130mg, "Double shot with microfoam"
- Black Coffee: 95mg, "Traditional brewed coffee"

### Component Parameters
- `SelectedValue` and `SelectedValueChanged` for single selection
- `SelectedValues` and `SelectedValuesChanged` for multi-selection
- `MultiSelect` boolean parameter
- `ShowCaffeineInfo` to display caffeine content
- `CssClass` for additional styling

## ü§ñ Copilot Prompt

```
Create a reusable Blazor component called `CoffeeTypeSelector` for selecting coffee types with visual cards in a .NET 8 Blazor Web App.

Component requirements:
- File location: `src/CoffeeTracker.Web/CoffeeTracker.Web/Components/Shared/CoffeeTypeSelector.razor`
- Reusable across different contexts
- Support both single and multi-selection modes
- Visual card-based interface with coffee type information

Card design for each coffee type:
1. Coffee type icon or emoji
2. Coffee type name (large, bold text)
3. Base caffeine content (e.g., "90mg")
4. Brief description
5. Selection indicator (border, checkmark, etc.)

Component parameters:
- SelectedValue/SelectedValueChanged for single selection
- SelectedValues/SelectedValuesChanged for multi-selection
- MultiSelect boolean parameter
- ShowCaffeineInfo display toggle
- CssClass for additional styling

Visual features:
- Responsive grid layout (1-2-3-4 columns based on screen size)
- Hover effects and smooth transitions
- Selected state visual feedback
- Touch-friendly sizing for mobile

Accessibility features:
- ARIA labels and descriptions
- Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, space/enter)
- Focus indicators
- Screen reader support

Create comprehensive unit tests using bUnit covering single/multi selection, keyboard navigation, and accessibility.

Example usage:
```razor
<CoffeeTypeSelector @bind-SelectedValue="selectedType" ShowCaffeineInfo="true" />
<CoffeeTypeSelector @bind-SelectedValues="selectedTypes" MultiSelect="true" />
```
```

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done

- [ ] CoffeeTypeSelector component created
- [ ] Visual card interface for all coffee types
- [ ] Single and multi-selection modes working
- [ ] Caffeine information display
- [ ] Keyboard navigation implemented
- [ ] Touch-friendly mobile interactions
- [ ] Accessibility features (ARIA, screen reader)
- [ ] Responsive grid layout
- [ ] Hover effects and animations
- [ ] Unit tests with >90% coverage
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Reusable component architecture
- [ ] Component documentation

## üîó Related Issues

- Depends on: Basic Blazor project setup
- Used by: #018 (Coffee Entry Form), #021 (Main Page)
- Epic: Epic 4 (Blazor UI Components)
- Works with: All Epic 4 form components

## üß™ Test Scenarios

- Single selection mode behavior
- Multi-selection mode behavior
- Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, space, enter)
- Touch interactions on mobile
- Accessibility compliance testing
- Parameter binding verification

     - page (int, default 1)
     - pageSize (int, default 20, max 100)
     - search (string, optional) - search by name
   - Return 200 OK with paginated results

2. GET /api/coffee-shops/{id}
   - Return specific coffee shop by ID
   - Return 200 OK with shop details
   - Return 404 Not Found if shop doesn't exist or inactive

3. GET /api/coffee-shops/search
   - Search coffee shops by name or address
   - Support query parameters:
     - q (string, required) - search query
     - page, pageSize (same as above)
   - Return 200 OK with search results
   - Return 400 Bad Request if query is empty

DTOs to create:
- CoffeeShopResponse (output DTO)
- CoffeeShopSearchResponse (search results with metadata)
- PagedResponse<T> (generic pagination wrapper)

Error handling:
- Use ProblemDetails for error responses
- Validate query parameters
- Handle service layer exceptions

Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation:
- Add XML documentation comments (/// <summary>) to all controller actions
- Use [ProducesResponseType] attributes to document all possible responses
- Include [SwaggerOperation] attributes for detailed endpoint descriptions
- Add parameter descriptions using [SwaggerParameter] attributes
- Document all HTTP status codes (200, 400, 404, 500)
- Include example responses for all endpoints
- Add API tags to group coffee shop endpoints together

XML Documentation Requirements:
- Document all controller actions with clear summaries
- Document all parameters with /// <param> tags
- Document return values with /// <returns> tags
- Include usage examples in documentation
- Document error scenarios and status codes

Example XML Documentation:
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Retrieves a paginated list of active coffee shops
/// </summary>
/// <param name="page">Page number (default: 1)</param>
/// <param name="pageSize">Number of items per page (default: 20, max: 100)</param>
/// <param name="search">Optional search term to filter by shop name</param>
/// <returns>A paginated list of coffee shops</returns>
/// <response code="200">Returns the paginated list of coffee shops</response>
/// <response code="400">Invalid pagination parameters</response>
[HttpGet]
[ProducesResponseType(typeof(PagedResponse<CoffeeShopResponse>), StatusCodes.Status200OK)]
[ProducesResponseType(typeof(ProblemDetails), StatusCodes.Status400BadRequest)]
```

Create comprehensive unit tests using xUnit and Moq that test:
- All endpoints with valid parameters
- Pagination scenarios
- Search functionality
- Error conditions (not found, invalid parameters)
- HTTP status codes and response formats

Place controller in `Controllers/CoffeeShopsController.cs` and tests in the test project.

- Fresh database state for each test class
- Load realistic seed data for testing
- Test complete HTTP request/response cycle

Test scenarios to cover:

1. GET /api/coffee-shops
   - Happy path: retrieve paginated coffee shops
   - Pagination: first page, middle page, last page
   - Page size validation: default, minimum, maximum
   - Empty results: when no shops exist
   - Performance: response time under load

2. GET /api/coffee-shops/{id}

   - Inactive shops: inactive shops return 404
   - Edge cases: negative IDs, zero, very large IDs

3. GET /api/coffee-shops/search
   - Happy path: search finds matching shops
   - Partial matches: search works with partial names
   - Case insensitive: uppercase/lowercase/mixed case
   - No results: search with no matches returns empty
   - Invalid input: empty search query returns 400
   - Special characters: search handles special characters

4. Pagination testing
   - Correct total count calculation
   - Correct page boundaries
   - Sort order consistency
   - Page size limits enforced

5. Performance tests
   - Search response time < 500ms with 1000 shops

- Search ranking/relevance

Error handling tests:
- Malformed requests
- Invalid query parameters
- Database connection issues (simulate)
- Large result sets

Swagger/OpenAPI tests:
- Verify /swagger endpoint includes coffee shop APIs
- Validate OpenAPI specification for coffee shop endpoints
- Test that all endpoints are documented with proper schemas
- Verify response examples are present and accurate
- Test API documentation accessibility and completeness

Create test utilities:
- Helper methods for creating test data

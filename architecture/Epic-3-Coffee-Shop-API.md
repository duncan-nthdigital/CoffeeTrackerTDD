### Task 3.1: Create Coffee Shop API Controller
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Priority:** High  

**Description:**
Create REST API endpoints for coffee shop data retrieval and basic search functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Controller handles GET /api/coffee-shops (list all active shops)
- [ ] Controller handles GET /api/coffee-shops/{id} (get shop details)
- [ ] Controller handles GET /api/coffee-shops/search (search by name/location)
- [ ] Proper error handling and validation
- [ ] Unit tests for all endpoints

**Technical Details:**
- Read-only API for Phase 1 (no creation/updates)
- Support basic search and filtering
- Return paginated results for large datasets

**Copilot Prompt:**
```
Create a `CoffeeShopsController` for a .NET 8 Web API project that provides coffee shop data for anonymous users.

Controller requirements:
- Base route: `[Route("api/coffee-shops")]`
- Read-only operations (GET only for Phase 1)
- Support anonymous access
- Use dependency injection for services

Endpoints needed:
1. GET /api/coffee-shops
   - Return list of active coffee shops
   - Support query parameters:
     - page (int, default 1)
     - pageSize (int, default 20, max 100)
     - search (string, optional) - search by name
   - Return 200 OK with paginated results

2. GET /api/coffee-shops/{id}
   - Return specific coffee shop by ID
   - Return 200 OK with shop details
   - Return 404 Not Found if shop doesn't exist or inactive

3. GET /api/coffee-shops/search
   - Search coffee shops by name or address
   - Support query parameters:
     - q (string, required) - search query
     - page, pageSize (same as above)
   - Return 200 OK with search results
   - Return 400 Bad Request if query is empty

DTOs to create:
- CoffeeShopResponse (output DTO)
- CoffeeShopSearchResponse (search results with metadata)
- PagedResponse<T> (generic pagination wrapper)

Error handling:
- Use ProblemDetails for error responses
- Validate query parameters
- Handle service layer exceptions

Create comprehensive unit tests using xUnit and Moq that test:
- All endpoints with valid parameters
- Pagination scenarios
- Search functionality
- Error conditions (not found, invalid parameters)
- HTTP status codes and response formats

Place controller in `Controllers/CoffeeShopsController.cs` and tests in the test project.

- "Java Junction", "Brew & Bite", "Steam & Bean"
- Chain references: "Metro Coffee", "City Roast", "Quick Cup"

Geographic diversity:
- Urban: downtown addresses, numbered streets
- Suburban: residential area addresses
- Small town: main street addresses
- Various formats: "123 Main St", "45 Oak Avenue", "Unit 5, Shopping Plaza"

Create unit tests that verify:
- Seed data loads correctly
- All shops have valid required fields
- No duplicate names in seed data
- Search functionality works with seeded data

Integrate with database initialization:
- Call seeder in DbContext initialization
- Ensure seeding only happens once

   - Longitude (decimal, nullable, precision 11,8)
   - HasCoordinates (computed property)

2. Create migration for new fields
   - Update existing seed data with realistic coordinates
   - Add indexes for geographic queries

Location services needed:
1. Create `ILocationService` interface with methods:
   - double CalculateDistance(decimal lat1, decimal lon1, decimal lat2, decimal lon2)
   - Task<IEnumerable<CoffeeShopResponse>> GetNearestShopsAsync(decimal latitude, decimal longitude, int maxResults, double maxDistanceKm)

   - Support for both miles and kilometers

API updates:
1. Add to CoffeeShopsController:
   - GET /api/coffee-shops/nearest?lat={lat}&lng={lng}&maxResults={n}&maxDistance={km}
   - Return shops sorted by distance with distance included

2. Update CoffeeShopResponse DTO:
   - Add optional Distance property (decimal, in km)
   - Add HasLocation property (bool)

Geographic features:
- Validate latitude (-90 to 90) and longitude (-180 to 180)
- Handle shops without coordinates gracefully
- Return distance in kilometers with 2 decimal precision
- Sort results by distance (nearest first)
- Limit results to reasonable radius (e.g., 50km max)

Seed data updates:
- Add realistic coordinates for major cities
- Use coordinates for diverse locations (US, Europe, Australia, etc.)
- Ensure coordinates match the addresses provided

Create comprehensive unit tests:
- Distance calculation accuracy (test known distances)
- Coordinate validation
- Nearest shops functionality
- Edge cases (North/South poles, International Date Line)
- Performance with large datasets

Note: This is a foundation for future GPS integration in mobile apps.

Place location service in `Services/LocationService.cs` and update relevant DTOs and controllers.

### Task 3.5: Create Coffee Shop Integration Tests
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Priority:** Medium  

**Description:**
Create integration tests for coffee shop API endpoints testing the complete flow.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Tests use TestServer and in-memory database
- [ ] Tests cover all API endpoints
- [ ] Tests verify search and pagination functionality
- [ ] Tests check performance requirements
- [ ] Tests run independently

**Technical Details:**
- Test with realistic seed data
- Verify search algorithms work correctly
- Test pagination edge cases
- Ensure performance benchmarks

**Copilot Prompt:**
```
Create comprehensive integration tests for the coffee shop API in a .NET 8 Web API project.

Test setup requirements:
- Use Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing.TestServer
- SQLite in-memory database with seed data
- Fresh database state for each test class
- Load realistic seed data for testing
- Test complete HTTP request/response cycle

Test scenarios to cover:

1. GET /api/coffee-shops
   - Happy path: retrieve paginated coffee shops
   - Pagination: first page, middle page, last page
   - Page size validation: default, minimum, maximum
   - Empty results: when no shops exist
   - Performance: response time under load

2. GET /api/coffee-shops/{id}
   - Happy path: valid shop ID returns shop details
   - Not found: invalid shop ID returns 404
   - Inactive shops: inactive shops return 404
   - Edge cases: negative IDs, zero, very large IDs

3. GET /api/coffee-shops/search
   - Happy path: search finds matching shops
   - Partial matches: search works with partial names
   - Case insensitive: uppercase/lowercase/mixed case
   - No results: search with no matches returns empty
   - Invalid input: empty search query returns 400
   - Special characters: search handles special characters

4. Pagination testing
   - Correct total count calculation
   - Correct page boundaries
   - Sort order consistency
   - Page size limits enforced

5. Performance tests
   - Search response time < 500ms with 1000 shops
   - Pagination performance with large datasets
   - Concurrent request handling
   - Cache effectiveness

Search algorithm tests:
- Exact name matches (highest priority)
- Partial name matches
- Address search functionality
- Fuzzy matching tolerance
- Search ranking/relevance

Error handling tests:
- Malformed requests
- Invalid query parameters
- Database connection issues (simulate)
- Large result sets

Create test utilities:
- Helper methods for creating test data
- Extensions for asserting API responses
- Performance measurement utilities
- Search relevance assertion helpers

Test data requirements:
- Use diverse coffee shop names for search testing
- Include edge cases (short names, long names, special characters)
- Test with both chain and independent shop names
- Include various address formats

Place integration tests in `CoffeeTracker.Api.IntegrationTests/CoffeeShops/`

Test naming convention: `{Method}_{Endpoint}_{Scenario}_ReturnsExpectedResult`
Example: `Get_CoffeeShops_WithValidPagination_ReturnsPagedResults`
```
